- I'm a passionate developer from Korea, specializing in ***automated systems*** including autonomous driving.  
- Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning are just tools to me; they are means to achieve broader goals and solve complex problems.
- I frequently work with `Python`, `Github`, `ROS` and `Ubuntu`.
- With `ChatGPT`, I am also proficient in `Pytorch`, `C++` and `Markdown`.
